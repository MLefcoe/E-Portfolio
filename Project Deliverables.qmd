### Tree Shade in UBC Neighbourhoods

Assessing the percentage of tree shade per neighbourhood that falls on buildings.

Example hourly tree shade from sunrise to sunset in Chancellor Place neighbourhood on a scale of 0 to 1, 0 being full shade. Generated from LiDAR in R.

Percentage of tree shade falling on buildings per neighbourhood, hourly from sunrise to sunset.

### Individual Tree Shade

#### Isolating the shade of individual trees for a species level analysis. Beginning from a point cloud clipped to a species of interest, ending with a shade model for a specific tree.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
eg_roi <- readLAS("C:/Users/mlefcoe.stu/Documents/Shade_Mapping_R/Outputs/eg_roi.las") 
plot(eg_roi)  
rgl::rglwidget()
```

Interactive point cloud for one area of interest filtered to display trees only.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
eg_roiindiv <- readLAS("C:/Users/mlefcoe.stu/Documents/Shade_Mapping_R/Outputs/eg_roi_indiv.las") 
plot(eg_roiindiv)  
rgl::rglwidget()
```

Same interactive point cloud with the central tree isolated and normalized ground points added back in.

Example tree shade cast by an individual tree every thirty minutes.

# Project 2 - Urban Heat Island Hotspots Montreal

The client for this project was Peter-Mcgill Community Table, looking to identify areas vulnerable to UHI in the district of Ville-Marie.
