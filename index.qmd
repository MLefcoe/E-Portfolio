I'm currently completing my Masters in Geomatics for Environmental Management at UBC in Vancouver. I'm originally from Montreal, where I completed my Bachelors in Environmental and Sustainability Science at Concordia University with a specialization in Biology. In this portfolio you'll find deliverables from projects I've completed, reports, and interesting maps and visuals I've created.
