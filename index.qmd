Hey there!

Welcome to my E-Portfolio. I'm currently completing my Masters in Geomatics for Environmental Management at UBC in Vancouver. I'm originally from Montreal, where I completed my Bachelors in Environmental and Sustainability Science at Concordia University with a specialization in Biology. For now I'm using this portfolio to showcase some cool vizualizations I've made.
